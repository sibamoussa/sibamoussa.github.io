Hi! I am Siba. Originally from Syria, I am a world-traveller who considers home to be many locations around our beautiful earth.

Born and raised in AbuDhabi (United Arab Emirates), I moved to the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia following my move to Canada in the early 2000's. I went to Texas A&M University at Qatar where I pursued my goals of obtaining a Chemical Engineering degree before I ended up in one of my favorite cities in Canada: Montreal! I am now working on my PhD in Chemistry from McGill University.
