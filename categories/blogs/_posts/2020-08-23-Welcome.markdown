Hi! I am Siba. Originally from Syria, I am now located in Philadelphia, USA. 

I grew up in the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar). I have a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Texas A&M University. More recently, I graduated with a PhD in Electrochemistry from McGill University.

Hobbies include traveling, programming, hanging out with my family and trying out all the chocolate deserts possible.
