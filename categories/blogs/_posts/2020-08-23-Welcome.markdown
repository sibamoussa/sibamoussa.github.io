Hi! I am Siba. Originally from Syria, I am now located in Montreal, Quebec. 

I grew up in the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar). I have a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Texas A&M University and I am finishing up my doctorate in Chemistry at McGill University.
