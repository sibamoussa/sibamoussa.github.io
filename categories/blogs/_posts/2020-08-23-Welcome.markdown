Hi! I am Siba. Originally from Syria, I am now located in Dubai, UAE. 

I grew up in the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar). I have a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I graduated with a PhD in Developing Biosensors for Neurological Applications from McGill University. I completed a postdoctoral program at McGill University where I worked with McGill and the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms, collaborating with Yoshua Bengio to build an active learning pipeline for predicting RNA and DNA sequences to be used in therapuetics and sensors. 

I am currently pursuing research in AI for physical science applications while also working at a soverign wealth fund in implementing technology driven solutions to provide improved patient care. 

Hobbies include traveling, programming, hanging out with my family and trying out all the chocolate deserts possible.
